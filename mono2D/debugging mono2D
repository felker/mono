debugging mono2D

The transport step is not working with the van Leer interpolation scheme

I am debugging the test case of one boundary having intensity 1.0

For x=LHS streaming case,
without abs() on cfl_mu

the first ray is normal (positive cosines)
but a ray with a negative mu_y blows up, with negative values


putting abs() as in mono1D will almost preserve the positive ray but makes the negative one blow up


abs() also blows up the donor case.... why is this different than the 1D formulation?

Is this a boundary condition problem? When i set LHS=1.0 but leave the other boundarys to evolve without resetting them to 0.0, we dont get the ray streams, just a sheet moving...


NVM, cfl_mu in the 1D code was also negative. No need for abs()

the first ray is the only one that is messed up

The donor cell method works but suffers high diffusion
the van leer method blows up most on cases when mu_x=mu=y are equal and positive. HOW DOES THE POSITIVITY PLAY INTO IT?

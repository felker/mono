I currently have two main solvers:

mono2D_relativistic: This special relativistic solver makes no v/c approximations and solves the formulation of the time-dependent RTE 

mono2D_decoupled: Solves time dependent RTE to O(v/c) with some (v/c)^2 correction terms in the style of Lowrie. My solver is a duplicate of the Jiang, et al 2014 publication. Currently does not implement scattering terms.  

Tests folder is divided first by solver, and then by type of test. Changes is parameters are indicated in the title of the file. 

Comparisons between the two solvers are located in a separate top-level directory.
